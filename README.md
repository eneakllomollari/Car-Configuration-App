# Kelley Blue Book Car Configuration Prototype
Car Configuration Java Application developed in six units.
Each unit provides learning opportunities in Object Oriented Design.
Concepts used include inner classes, exceptions, file I/O, cloning, multi-threading, Web
Programming with Java Server Pages and Servlets.

Unit breakdown:
1. Develop a “reference” base object model, read a text file to build the reference base
object model and archive it using serialization.
2. Expand the proof of concept, by building API’s for car configuration classes, using
interfaces and abstract classes and add a custom exception handler, to enhance the
design.
3. Reimplement the current system with the same functionality, but with code that's better
designed to handle multiple models.
4. Make the app scalable, so that the application can handle concurrency, by adding new
functionality in new classes without modifying our existing code too much.
5. Build on previous unit and create a client server application using java.net API.
6. Extend this system, so that it can be used over the web. Needed to extend the
functionality using Servlets, JavaServer Pages and Apache Tomcat
